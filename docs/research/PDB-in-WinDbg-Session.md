# Fix Symbol loading for Kernel Driver minidump analysis

## Preparations

You need to have the exact same version of the **driver binary** (`.sys` file) and the **debug information file** (PDB) ready on the machine running the WinDbg session.

## Debugging session

First, **triple-check** that you've got a local symbol cache configured **and** have the Microsoft Symbol Server referenced in the session:

```text
.sympath cache*D:\symbols;srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

In this example, my local path where symbols get stored and looked up from is `D:\symbols`, adjust to your system accordingly. Symbol loading can be sped up tremendously if you keep the same local cache path in between debugging sessions. Then turn on "noisy symbol loading" to get vital details about the symbol loading process:

```text
!sym noisy
```

All set, now force reloading all symbols, this will spit out a great deal of diagnostics:

```text
.reload /n /f
```

Once done, look for the first occurrence of a line similar to the following:

```text
SYMSRV:  UNC: d:\symbols\mydriver.sys\620F6CF740000\mydriver.sys - path not found
```

Where `mydriver.sys` is replaced with the driver you're debugging. Create the directory structure `d:\symbols\mydriver.sys\620F6CF740000\` with PowerShell:

```PowerShell
New-Item -Type Directory -Path "d:\symbols\mydriver.sys\620F6CF740000\"
```

Put the driver **binary** file `mydriver.sys` in this directory.

Now we'll determine the location where the debugger will expect the PDB. We can get this information with the `symchk` tool (included in the Windows Driver SDK, typical location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64`) in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('_NT_SYMBOL_PATH','cache*D:\symbols;srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols')
symchk /v /os "D:\symbols\mydriver.sys\620F6CF740000\mydriver.sys"
```

Look for the first occurrence of this line:

```text
SYMSRV:  UNC: D:\symbols\mydriver.pdb\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\mydriver.pdb - file not found
```

Yet again back in PowerShell, create this directory structure:

```PowerShell
New-Item -Type Directory -Path "D:\symbols\mydriver.pdb\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\"
```

Finally, place the **PDB file** in this directory.

If you now run the `symchk` command again, the output should have changed to:

```text
SYMSRV:  PATH: D:\symbols\mydriver.pdb\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\mydriver.pdb
SYMSRV:  RESULT: 0x00000000
```

!!! important "Watch out for mismatched pdb"
    If you also get a line similar to
    ```text
    DBGHELP: D:\symbols\mydriver.pdb\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\mydriver.pdb - mismatched pdb
    ```
    the PDB file used is the wrong version, most probably from a newer or older build and must be replaced with the correct one!

Finally back in WinDbg we can invoke another symbol loading:

```text
.reload /n /f
```

After these steps, the items in the call stack should be resolved to proper function names:

```text
9: kd> kc
 # Call Site
00 nt!KeBugCheckEx
01 Wdf01000!Mx::MxBugCheckEx
02 Wdf01000!FxVerifierBugCheckWorker
03 Wdf01000!FxVerifierNullBugCheck
04 Wdf01000!imp_WdfObjectGetTypedContextWorker
05 mydriver!WdfObjectGetTypedContextWorker
06 mydriver!DeviceRequestContextGet
07 mydriver!EvtRequestCompletionTimer
08 Wdf01000!FxTimer::TimerHandler
09 Wdf01000!FxTimer::_FxTimerWorkItemCallback
0a Wdf01000!FxSystemWorkItem::WorkItemHandler
0b Wdf01000!FxSystemWorkItem::_WorkItemThunk
0c nt!IopProcessWorkItem
0d nt!ExpWorkerThread
0e nt!PspSystemThreadStartup
0f nt!KiStartSystemThread
```
